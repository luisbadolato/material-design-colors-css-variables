## Material Colors Palette

Css files including variables for all colors included on the [Material Design Color Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/)

Based on MrGrigri's repo [Material Design Color Palette](https://gist.github.com/MrGrigri/9b11ab71117a30a7ecfc85055f203be2), edited for my own ease of use and including files with and without prefixes.
